// Javascript embedded in a page

// Variable declaration
// `<kind> <variableName> = <expression>`
// kind can be choosen from the set { let, var, const } 
// `const`s cannot be reassigned
// `let` and `var` are similar, but have a subtle difference
// `variableName` cannot have whitespace, but can have underscores '_'
// an `expression` can be just a value
// One kind of such value is a `string`, a sequence of characters
//		Strings begin with a single or double quote, or a backtick
//		they end with the same character they begin with:
var name = "Chuck";
// Another kind of value is a `number`, which we can do math with
var numPizzas = 25;
// We could also use 'prompt' to take input from the user.
//		This pauses the page and displays a dialog.
// var numPizzas = prompt("How many pizzas do you want?");
// This would probably point to the same memory as 'name'
var bestGuyEver = "Chuck";
// Another kind of value is a `boolean`, a `true` or `false`.
var awesome = true;

// We can also do math in the expression 
var cost = numPizzas * 5.00;

// Function call
// `<functionName> ( <parameters> )`
// `<functionName> ( <expression <, expression?>* >? )`
// Previously was 'alert', which would pause the page,
//		and display a window
